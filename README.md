## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer, avoiding collisions with walls and yourself.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases as the snake eats food. Your current score is displayed on the screen.
- **High Score**: The highest score is stored in localStorage so that it persists across sessions.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- The goal is to eat the food (represented as small squares) to grow the snake.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail.
- Your score will increase with each food eaten, and the highest score will be saved and displayed.
